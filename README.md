<h2>Week 4 Assignment </h2>

This repo contains 3 files:

    1. Week4_FinalWorks.R - R script to perform analysis
    2. CodeBook.md - used to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
    3. Tidy.txt - the tidy data from the final question of the assignment

To run the analysis script, you need to make sure the extracted files from Zip are in one place. Install plyr package in your R environment.
